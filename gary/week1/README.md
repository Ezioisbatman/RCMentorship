# Week 1 Progress
This is recorded in the middle of week 1 and will be updated.

## What I have done
* Read the abstract and background parts of Barbour's thesis
* Setup Anaconda

## Plan for rest of week
* Pass Hyak quiz
* Install required softwares (3dSlicer, paraview and vmtk).
* Reproduce vascular model with vmtk
* Learn algorithms used previously for vessel segmentation

## Who I have worked with
* No one

## Plan for next week
* Implement vessel segmentation algorithms or compile and run an existing one
* Assess the difficulties and prerequisites for improving upon those algorithms
* Talk to Kurt about the feasibility of devising a better algorithm for vessel segmentation.

## Plan for rest of quarter
* Not very sure at this moment. Need to talk to Kurt about the prospect
of vessel segmentation and whether AD and I have enough technical understanding
and data to reasonably create and implement an algorithm better than the existing ones. If
not, then we might need to reposition ourselves.
